# TPTweak

TPTweak is a debugging tool to help adjust your iOS app on the fly without recompile.
inspired by facebook's [Tweak](https://github.com/facebookarchive/Tweaks), TPTweak is fully written in swift, and with simpler API.

# Installation
## Swift Package Manager
With xcode, add this URL
```
https://github.com/tokopedia/ios-tptweak
```

or manually add to your `Package.swift`
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/tokopedia/ios-tptweak", from: "1.0.0"),
```

# Cocoapods
add this to your `Podfile`
```
pod 'TPTweak', '~> 1.0.0'
```

# Nomenclature
`TPTweakEntry` = Representation of option on TPTweak

`TPTweakStore` = Brain of TPTweak, all logic of storing, reading and mutating value of TPTweak.
# TPTweakEntry
TPTweakEntry will represent a option on TPTweak.

```swift
TPTweakEntry(
    category: "Tracking",
    section: "Tracking",
    cell: "Enable Tracking",
    footer: "Turn this on to enable tracking",
    type: .switch(defaultValue: true)
)
```
- category: will be a cell on the first page
- section: will be a group of section on the second page
- cell: will be the name of the cell inside the section
- footer: add footer on the end of the section.(if multiply detected, will use the last one)
- type: the type of cell you want to use

### TPTweakEntry type
**Switch**

![](assets/switch.png)
Using this type, you can create a cell with a UISwitch to enable/disable an option.You could also supply default value, if no value detected.

```swift
.switch(defaultValue: true)
```


You could also add `closure: ((Bool) -> Void)?` that will run **after** the value is changed.

```swift
.switch(defaultValue: true, closure: { isToggledOn in
    UserDefaults.standard.set(isToggledOn, forKey: "myvalue_is_on")
})
```

**Strings**

![](assets/strings.png)
Using this type, you can create a selection of strings.When user tap the options, it will automatically open the selection.

```swift
.strings(item: ["US", "UK", "SG"], selected: "SG")
```

**Numbers**

![](assets/numbers.png)
Using this type, you can create a selectio of numbers.When user tap the options, it will automatically open the selection.

```swift
.numbers(item: [10, 15, 20], selected: 10)
```

**Action**

![](assets/action.png)
Using this type, it gives you the flexibility to do everything. with given `closure`, you can for example, open custom page you create, or executing a `UserDefaults`, or more.

```swift
.action({
    UserDefaults.standard.set(true, forKey: "clear_cache")
    Cache.clear()
})
```

# How to Use

## Creating your TPTweakEntry
first you need to create your entry, we recommend to create an extension and put every entry definition as a static.

```swift
import TPTweak

extension TPTweakEntry {
    static let enableTracking = TPTweakEntry(
        category: "Tracking",
        section: "Tracking",
        cell: "Enable Tracking",
        footer: "Turn this on to enable tracking",
        type: .switch(defaultValue: true)
    )
}
```
## Registering your TPTweakEntry
once you create your entry, you need to register it to TPTweak so it will show up on TPTweak page. This can be achieved by calling `register()` on each entry.

You can call it whenever you want, but we suggest to put it on your `AppDelegate`'s `internal func application(_: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions _: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?)`

```swift
internal func application(_: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions _: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        // register TPTweak Entry
        TPTweakEntry.enableTracking.register()
    }
```

## Openning TPTweak page

openning TPTweak is achievable by openning `TPTweakViewController`. but the easier way is to replace your `UIWindow` with `TPTweakShakeWindow`.

### Manual
```swift
// without nav
let viewController = TPTweakViewController()
self.navigationController?.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)

// with nav
let tptweakWithNav = TPTweakWithNavigatationViewController()
self.present(tptweakWithNav)
```

### Shake (Recommended)
```swift
@UIApplicationMain
internal final class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    internal var window: UIWindow?

    internal func application(_: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions _: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        // register TPTweakShakeWindow to enable openning TPTweak from shaking the device
        window = TPTweakShakeWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)
        ...
    }
}

```

## Use TPTweak Value
Once your TPTweakEntry is set, you can get and set a value from it.

### Read value
```
// will return true or false based on latest value changed on TPTweak
let isTrackingEnable = TPTweakEntry.enableTracking.getValue(Bool.self) 
```

### Set value
if you want to set the value manually programmatically
```
TPTweakEntry.enableTracking.setValue(true)
```
